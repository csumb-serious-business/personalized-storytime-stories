I Want a Monkey
${protagonist} was sure that he wanted a pet.

He talked to ${dad} about which pet to get.



“I want a Monkey who scratches his head!

He’d swing in the house and he’d jump on the bed.”



“Well,” said ${dad} in a kind sort of way,

“Did you know that monkeys eat bugs everyday?”



“Oh No,” ${protagonist} said, “We have none to eat.”

${mom} likes to squash all the bugs with her feet.”



“Then I want a Hippo!” he screamed to ${dad}.

“He’d eat all our trash, and ${mom} would be glad!”



“Hippos need water, it helps them stay cool.

I guess we can build him a giant sized pool.”



“No,” ${protagonist} said, “he’d be too big to dry,

We’d need a mountain of towels to try.”



“I want an Otter who triple back flips,

I’d practice swimming when we go for dips.”



“Did you know most otters can whistle and chirp?

They growl and snort, and perhaps even burp?”



“Oh,” ${protagonist} said with a sad looking frown,

“We’d have to tell him to keep the noise down.”



“Let’s get a Giraffe!” ${protagonist} said with a smile.

“I’d slide from his neck to a giant clothes pile!”



“Giraffes hold the record for tallest of all.”

“The jump from their head is a twenty foot fall!”

“Gosh,” ${protagonist} said as he looked at the ceiling,

He’d bump his head even if he were kneeling.”



“Well how ‘bout a bunny?” he said to ${dad},

“A fluffy and floppy one can’t be that bad.”



“Bunnies like eating and chew all your stuff.

 Raising a bunny can really be tough.”



“Wow,” ${protagonist} answered, “Is that really true?

Picking a pet is not easy to do.”



“I want a ${pet-species}!” ${protagonist} said, “Let’s get one!”

“I think a ${pet-species} could be lots of fun.”



“Hmm,” said ${dad}, with a look of delight.

“Good idea ${protagonist}; I think that you’re right!”



“They’re really good swimmers and make funny faces.

And if we get two, we could watch them have races!”



“Okay,” said ${dad}, “That’s just what we’ll do.

One ${pet-species} for me, one ${pet-species} for you!”
