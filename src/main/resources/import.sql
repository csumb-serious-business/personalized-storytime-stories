insert ignore into `story` (`id`, `title`, `content`) values(1, 'I Want a Monkey', '${protagonist} was sure that he wanted a pet.

He talked to ${dad} about which pet to get.



“I want a Monkey who scratches his head!

He’d swing in the house and he’d jump on the bed.”



“Well,” said ${dad} in a kind sort of way,

“Did you know that monkeys eat bugs everyday?”



“Oh No,” ${protagonist} said, “We have none to eat.”

${sister} likes to squash all the bugs with her feet.”



“Then I want a Hippo!” he screamed to ${dad}.

“He’d eat all our trash, and ${mom} would be glad!”



“Hippos need water, it helps them stay cool.

I guess we can build him a giant sized pool.”



“No,” ${protagonist} said, “he’d be too big to dry,

We’d need a mountain of towels to try.”



“I want an Otter who triple back flips,

I’d practice swimming when we go for dips.”



“Did you know most otters can whistle and chirp?

They growl and snort, and perhaps even burp?”



“Oh,” ${protagonist} said with a sad looking frown,

“We’d have to tell him to keep the noise down.”



“Let’s get a Giraffe!” ${protagonist} said with a smile.

“I’d slide from his neck to a giant clothes pile!”



“Giraffes hold the record for tallest of all.”

“The jump from their head is a twenty foot fall!”

“Gosh,” ${protagonist} said as he looked at the ceiling,

He’d bump his head even if he were kneeling.”



“Well how ‘bout a bunny?” he said to ${dad},

“A fluffy and floppy one can’t be that bad.”



“Bunnies like eating and chew all your stuff.

 Raising a bunny can really be tough.”



“Wow,” ${protagonist} answered, “Is that really true?

Picking a pet is not easy to do.”



“I want a ${pet-species}!” ${protagonist} said, “Let’s get one!”

“I think a ${pet-species} could be lots of fun.”



“Hmm,” said ${dad}, with a look of delight.

“Good idea ${protagonist}; I think that you’re right!”



“They’re really good swimmers and make funny faces.

And if we get two, we could watch them have races!”



“Okay,” said ${dad}, “That’s just what we’ll do.

One ${pet-species} for me, one ${pet-species} for you!”'),

(2, 'The Friendly Girrafe', 'Once upon a time, there was a giraffe named
${protagonist}. ${protagonist} lived in Kenya, a country in
Africa. Like all giraffes, ${protagonist} had a long neck
and long legs. Because she was so tall, she was
able to eat food from the very tops of the trees in
the savannah. The savannah in Africa is an area
with lots of grass and some trees. Sometimes, a
savannah is called grasslands. The other animals
like zebras and ${pet-species} could not reach where
${protagonist} could reach. But ${protagonist} always found
food. She loved the leaves and the new buds of the
trees.

One day, ${protagonist} was busy eating her favorite
leaves along with some other giraffes. It was a
bright sunny day and there was not a cloud in the
sky. It had not rained for a long time, so the grass
was very dry. She heard a noise down at the
bottom of her extra long legs: it was her friend,
${pet} the ${pet-species}. ${pet} was trying to say
something, but ${protagonist} couldn’t understand what
he was saying. He looked very tired. “What’s
wrong?” asked ${protagonist}. ${protagonist} was a very kind
giraffe and wanted to help everyone.
Just then ${pet} fell over!

${protagonist} was also a smart giraffe. She knew what
was wrong. ${pet} couldn’t find anything to eat
and he was very hungry. ${protagonist} nibbled some
fresh, tender leaves and buds from the top of the
tree where she was eating. She dropped some
of the leaves and buds to the ground near where
${pet} was. Then she nudged him a little with
the hoof at the bottom of one of her very long legs.
“Wake up, ${pet}!” said ${protagonist}.
“I’ve found something for you to eat.”
Slowly ${pet} sat up and ate a little.
“Thank you, ${protagonist},” said ${pet}.

After a while, when ${pet} was feeling better,
${protagonist} asked him, “What’s happened, ${pet}?
Why are you so hungry? Why can’t you find
anything to eat?” ${pet} said, “It hasn’t
rained for so long and now there’s no more
food.” “That’s not good,” said ${protagonist}. “What’s
happening with the other animals?” “No one
knows what to do,” answered ${pet}. “All the
zebras and the ${pet-species} and the elephants are
getting worried about the dry grass.
Some of them are thinking about leaving the
savannah and trying to reach the jungle.”
“That’s a long trip,” said ${protagonist}.
“Are you going to go with them?”

“I don’t know,” answered ${pet}. “What do
you think we should do?” ${protagonist} thought for a
while and then suddenly, she had a good idea. “We
should go talk to ${dad} the Lion. He is the smartest
animal in the savannah!” ${pet} was too tired to
walk, so ${protagonist} invited him to ride on her back.
“Hold on tight to my neck,” said ${protagonist}. “There’s
a lot to hold on to,” joked ${pet}. ${protagonist}
laughed. “You’re right. I’ve got the longest neck
in Africa!” So they started their journey across to
the other side of the savannah to look for ${dad}.

${protagonist} and ${pet} were in luck! ${dad} was sitting
up on a rock and he was really easy to see as they
walked through the grass. “Hi, ${dad}!” they both
shouted. ${dad} had been napping and was a little
grumpy when they woke him up. But he was
polite and said, “Hello ${protagonist} and ${pet}. Why
did you walk the whole way across the savannah?
Just to wake me up?” But he was joking; he had
a smile on his face. “${pet} says that there is
no food left on the savannah because it’s been
so dry,” said ${protagonist}. “Do you have any ideas?”

${dad} thought for a while. He said, “There’s nothing
we can do about the rain. It will come soon, but
we can’t be sure when it will arrive. When the
rain comes, all the plants will grow again and
there will be lots of food for everybody.”
He thought a little longer. “The only thing I can
think of is for everyone to move closer to the
forest,” he continued. “There will be more things
to eat there, but I know it’s a long trip and it will
not be very easy. It might take days to get there.”

${protagonist} and ${pet} looked at each other and
then looked back at ${dad}. “Thank you, ${dad},” said
${protagonist}. “It’s probably best if they all try to get
closer to the jungle.” They said goodbye and then
walked back across the savannah.

Now they needed to gather all of the animals
together to start the long journey. ${protagonist} didn’t
need to go along because she had plenty of food in
her high trees. But she was a good friend
and wanted to help as much as she could.
They walked towards her favorite trees
and guess what she and ${pet} saw?

All of the animals were already gathered there and
waiting for ${protagonist} and ${pet}! “Why are you
all here?” asked ${protagonist}. “${mom} the Eagle told us
that you’re taking us to the edge of the jungle,”
said one of the zebras. “How did he know?” asked
${pet}. “He heard you talking with ${dad},” said
one of the ${pet-species}. “So you’ve all decided to
try to walk together to the jungle?” asked ${protagonist}.

“Yes,” they all answered. “If you’ll help us to get
there,” added one of the elephants. “Of course,
I’ll help,” said ${protagonist}. “I’m your friend.”
So they started on their big journey across the
savannah to the jungle. The sun was so hot and
there was no food and no place to get a drink of
water. And then they heard it. It was thunder!

“Thunder!” they all shouted. Thunder was very
scary to the animals of the savannah. Can you
guess why? Fire! Sometimes the lightning hits
the dry grass and the whole savannah catches fire.
Then everyone has to run. And that is exactly
what happened. “Fire!” they shouted. They
could smell it. And now they could see it.
The fire was coming towards them!

${protagonist} had to think fast. Because she was so
tall she could see farther than any of the other
animals. She stretched her long neck up as far
as she could. Now she could see a place where
there was no fire. “Quick!” she said. “Everyone
run this way.” All of the animals followed her
and ran as fast as they could. Soon, they were
out of danger. They stopped and gathered
together one more time. “Is everyone here?”
${protagonist} asked. She wanted to make sure they
were all safe. All the animals looked around;
they were all there.

And then the most wonderful thing happened.
“I felt a drop,” said a zebra. “Me too,” said an
antelope. It was rain! Finally! Everyone was
very happy. It started to rain a little more and
then a little more. The rain put out the fire so
they didn’t have to run. And the rain filled their
watering holes and made the plants grow again,
so they didn’t have to make that long trip to the
edge of the jungle. Everyone would soon have
enough food and water. So ${protagonist}, the Giraffe
went back to her favorite tree and continued
to munch on the leaves and buds.'),

(3, 'Space Captain', 'Princess ${sister} always has the best birthday parties
and this year friends from all over the galaxy were
heading to her planet to enjoy the celebrations.
Captain ${protagonist} and his wonder ${pet-species} ${pet} had
picked the perfect present for their inspiring friend.
However, Captain ${protagonist}’s arch nemesis, the evil
Doctor ${brother} was determined that there would be no
birthday cake for the pair at the end of this trip.

The golden Yellow Rocketship stood proudly on the
launch pad ready for takeoff. Captain ${protagonist} had
just finished loading Princess ${sister}’s awkwardly long
birthday present. “That’s it, ${pet}.” he said patting
his faithful ${pet-species}. “Now I just need to go and return all
this wrapping paper.”and he headed towards the
hanger while untangling himself from all the super
sticky tape he’d used to wrap up the gift.

${pet} gave a happy bark and off Captain
${protagonist} went into the space hanger. As ${pet}
returned to the spaceship he thought he saw
someone walking away from their Rocket Ship.
He looked familiar; was that Doctor ${brother}?
Later, in the ship all systems were go. Lights blinked,
screens lit up and Captain ${protagonist} and ${pet}
were strapped in ready to go.

“5,4,3,2,1, Blast Off and away we go.” shouted
Captain ${protagonist}, a big grin on his face whenever
he headed back out into space. Today ${pet}
only gave a little whimper though;
what was that Doctor ${brother} up to?
On Doctor ${brother}’s great black ship however,
there was only laughter, the kind only an evil
genius can produce; deep from the stomach
and exploding from the mouth.
“Good luck Captain ${protagonist},
enjoy your ride.”

Both ships were now busy with the sound of song:
“Roaring in our Rocket, flying really fast,
Being in a spaceship is a blast blast blast!”
sang Captain ${protagonist}.

While on the dark ship of ${brother} his creepy
chorus rang out:
“My mean machine is in the socket.
It will make the Captain Fluster.
Magnetic power will route his rocket
To the Crazy Comet Cluster”

“Not long now, ${pet}. Princes ${sister}’s planet is just
around the next sun.” explained Captain ${protagonist}.
Out of the window ${pet} stared at the golden
planets, and the shining suns flying past
as they hurtled through space.

“WahWahWah”. The cool hum of the spaceship was
suddenly thrown into chaos as the red warning light
flashed and the ship suddenly and
sharply turned around.

“Oh no!” cried Captain ${protagonist}. “We’re going the
wrong way”. ${pet} looked at the screen and saw
where they were headed: “Oh no, indeed!”
The yellow rocket ship was now headed towards
the Crazy Comet Cluster, the zaniest place in space.

Hundreds of blazing red comets swarmed around a
golden Yellow sun and if a spaceship got too close,
they would chase and churn it for hours upon hours.
${pet} barked and ran to the back of the ship.
“Don’t worry, boy.” said Captain ${protagonist}. “It will
be ok….I hope.” as he started pressing buttons and
fighting with the spaceships steering wheel. Sweat
broke out on his forehead and his eyes widened
into two moons of panic.

${pet} was not really scared, however, he was
searching for whatever the mischievous Doctor ${brother}
had hidden on their ship. ${pet} knew that it was
the only reason they were in trouble, but what was it?

Watching from behind a small green moon was
the shadowy spaceship of Doctor ${brother}. A big smile
of satisfaction grew on his face as he watched
the Captain’s ship head towards the Crazy Comet
Cluster. Once again his evil laugh echoed
around the gleaming cockpit of his ship.
“Magnetic force, keep that rocket off course.”
he whispered to himself.

${pet} knew they were almost out of time when
he saw it; or rather he sniffed out the evil stench
of where Doctor ${brother} had been. It was a small
blinking box just underneath the main computer.
That had to be it. Doctor ${brother} had made the yellow
rocket go in the wrong direction using one of
his mischief machines. Quick as a flash ${pet}
snatched the box in his jaws and teetering along the
lengthy birthday gift threw it to the Space Particle
Accelerator Machine (SPAM for short).He then used
his paws and sent the device back to Doctor ${brother}’s
nearby ship. ‘Lets see how much he enjoys those
crazy comets.’ thought ${pet}.

Back on the bridge Captain ${protagonist} was
still banging, twisting pushing and pressing
everything he could, When suddenly the ship turned
around and headed back to Princess ${sister}’s planet.
${pet} trotted in and gave a friendly happy bark.
“I told you not to worry ${pet}; as I say ‘with the
Captain around a solution is found.’”
${pet} gave a happy bark before picking up
his favourite bone and settling back to enjoy the
remainder of the journey.

A short while later Captain ${protagonist} and ${pet}
were getting hugs and high fives as Princess ${sister}
opened up her birthday present.“Anti-Gravity skies!
“Cool!” she said while up above some crazy comets
were chasing a rather unhappy Doctor ${brother}.');
